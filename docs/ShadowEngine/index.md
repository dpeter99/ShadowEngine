# Shadow Engine
Shadow Engine is a small game engine that i have been developing for the last few months. It started as a simple OOP rewrite to my Small 2D game/engine written in pure C ( [Relic Engine](https://gitlab.com/GD-SouceMakers/relicengine-group/relicengine) ). And I was planning to add a experimental realtime 2d shadows. But in the second half of 2019 I had a Uni course that was about DirectX12 so i decided to implement a 3D rendering as a assignment for the class.


Used tech:
- SDL2
- Assimp
- DriectX12
- GLM
- ImGUI
- spdlog
